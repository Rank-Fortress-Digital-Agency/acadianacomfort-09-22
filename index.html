                <p>
                    As the weather gets warmer, many people are turning on their air conditioners for the first time this year. But before you settle into an incredible summer comfort, it’s important to remember that regular A/C maintenance is key to keeping your home comfortable all season long.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just like your car needs a tune-up now and then, your <a href="https://acadianacomfort.com/why-is-my-air-conditioner-running-but-not-cooling-the-house/">air conditioner needs periodic servicing to keep it running</a> at peak efficiency. Neglecting to maintain your A/C can lead to higher energy bills and an uncomfortable home environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But don’t worry – <a href="https://acadianacomfort.com/keep-your-7-ways-to-keep-your-ac-in-top-shape/">keeping your A/C in good shape</a> is not difficult or expensive. All you need is a little knowledge and some essential tools. Here are some tips to get you started:

                <h2>
                    Check the air filter:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The <a href="https://acadianacomfort.com/how-to-choose-an-air-conditioning-unit-that-is-right-for-you/">air filter is one of the essential parts of your A/C unit</a> and is also one of the easiest to check. At least once a month, remove the air filter and hold it to the light. If you can see through it, then it’s still good. But if it’s clogged with dust and debris, it’s time to replace it. A clogged air filter can restrict airflow and cause your A/C unit to work harder, leading to higher energy bills and potential damage to your unit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When replacing your air filter, be sure to get the right size. An air filter that’s too small won’t do an excellent job of filtering out pollutants, while one that’s too large can restrict airflow. Check your A/C unit’s manual or the manufacturer’s website to find the right size air filter for your model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to monthly check-ups, it’s also a good idea to clean or replace your <a href="https://acadianacomfort.com/get-cool-again-regular-air-conditioner-maintenance/">air filter at the beginning of the cooling</a> season and the end of the heating season. This will help ensure that your A/C unit runs at peak efficiency when you need it most.

                            Clean the coils:
                        </h2>
                        <hr>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The coils help cool the air, so <a href="https://acadianacomfort.com/why-keeping-your-a-c-in-good-repair-is-essential-for-your-health/">keeping them clean is essential</a>. You can clean them yourself with a brush or a vacuum attachment. Once a year, you should also use a commercial coil cleaner according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Be sure to turn off your A/C unit before cleaning the coils. And be careful not to damage the fins on the coils, as this can restrict airflow and cause your unit to work harder.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You should also check the evaporator coils if you have a central A/C unit. These are located inside the house, so you’ll need to remove the access panel to get to them. As with the other coils, turn off your A/C unit before cleaning and handle the coils carefully to avoid damaging them.

                    Check the refrigerant:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The refrigerant is what cools the air, so it’s essential to ensure enough of it. You can check the level yourself with a simple gauge or have a professional do it. If the level is low, it may need to be recharged.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be aware that some refrigerants can harm the environment, so it’s essential to dispose of them properly. You may also need a license to handle or recharge refrigerant, so it’s best to leave this task to a professional.

                    Clean the condenser:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The condenser is located outside so that it can get dusty and dirty. To clean it, turn off your A/C unit and use a brush or vacuum attachment to remove debris. Once a year, you should also use a commercial coil cleaner according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s also essential to keep the area around the condenser clear. Trim back any foliage and remove any other objects that could block airflow. A well-ventilated condenser will work more efficiently and help prolong the life of your A/C unit.

                            The area around your A/C unit should be clear of debris like leaves and grass. If the unit is blocked, then it won’t be able to work correctly. You should also check the outdoor A/C unit to see if there is any debris or dirt around it. If so, you’ll need to clean it so the unit can work properly.
                        </p>

                            If your home has an A/C unit, you’ll need to take some steps to ensure it stays in good working condition. One of the most important things to do is to keep the area around the unit clear of debris. Leaves and grass can quickly block the unit and prevent it from working correctly. You should also check the outdoor A/C unit for dirt and debris build-up. If any is present, be sure to clean it so that the unit can function correctly.
